# Welcome to my new blog

Hey and welcome to my new blog!

In the past few days i've been completely remaking my portfolio site. Currently i am completely done with the home and CV page, and started working on the blog page!

Im also planning to add a projects page where you can view a list of all projects ive worked on, including buttons to the repository, and a button to download the resulting executable/script
